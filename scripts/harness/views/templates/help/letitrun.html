<p>Let's run the simulation on automatic by pressing the play button:
	<a class="btn btn-primary" href="#" title="Start the simulation" >
		<i class="glyphicon glyphicon-play"></i>
	</a>
	You can stop at any time with the stop button.

<p><strong>ArraySource1</strong> will loop round its three classes, presenting each to the PSOM.</p>

<p><strong>PSOM3</strong> will initially grow to accept the new class and then over time it will push dissimilar classes apart and break long links. Neurons without any links are removed. Eventually, you should have three tight neuron clusters floating in the middle.</p>

<p><strong>ScalarSink2</strong> will still be showing the last error, probably below 0.01.</p>
