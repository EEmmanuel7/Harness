<p>Welcome to Rob Lang's Artificial Intelligence Harness, a playground to experiment with dynamic neural networks.</p>
<p>Dynamic neural networks (DNN) grow to learn new classes and shrink to forget noise. Unlike other other neural networks (MLP, SOM), DNN work against nonstationary streams of data where classes can appear and disappear after training has begun.<br/>
