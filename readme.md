Harness
=======
Harness is a browser based toolbox playground for neural networks, currently in development. The user drags and drops computational blocks onto a workspace and then connects them together to move data between blocks.

How to get Harness running
------------------
Download the source and then simply load index.html into your favourite browser (only tested in Chrome). Everything runs in the browser.

What's here so far
-----------------
The harness is currently being built with just one source and one sink. A soure provides data, a sink collects it. All you can do is add simple scalar (single value) sources and sinks to the harnes, join them up and run the simulation through once.

Also in the code distribution is the Plastic Self Organising Map code that will end up moving into the engine.
